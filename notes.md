# Class notes

### Github assignment
- In Github, commits push the (staged with `git add`) changes you have made to a remote cloud repository. Pulling (i.e. with `git pull`) updates the local repository to match.
- In VSCode, there are various tools to make this process easier, such as a place to put the commit messages, extensions that help to visualize, and various other tools.
- Markdown format is detailed [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#quoting-code) and is definitely something to be acquainted with.
