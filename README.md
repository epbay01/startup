Long-term project for CS 260

Notes of what I have learned from the class are contained in [these notes](notes.md).

## Project Specification

### Elevator Pitch
Have you ever wondered, for some common questions, what do people generally actually think? Which _did_ come first, the chicken, or the egg? In this web application, these questions will finally be answered. Based on an old Wii app, this website will have new questions daily, then keep track of the universal response to that question. Each user votes, and adds to a base tally, so that people from anywhere can vote and see others' opinions.

Key features include:
- Accounts, to keep track of votes and previous votes
- Global interaction through voting
-
